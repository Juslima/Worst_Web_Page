Assignment/recommendations: (5 = Good)

In the creation of the "Worst Web Page Ever,". I followed the instructions on how to create a bad web design. This project was intended to serve as an illustrative example of what not to do when designing a website, with a deliberate exaggeration of several design flaws.

The provided HTML files (index.html, page1.html, page2.html) and the style.css file fulfill the requirements as follow:

A. Create a basic HTML site with 3 links that direct to 3 web pages:
   - I created 3 separate HTML files for each web page (index.html, page1.html, page2.html).
   - I added 3 links (Home, Page 1, Page 2) to your main page (index.html) and linked them to the respective HTML files.

B. Research websites:
   - I created a deliberately poorly designed website for inspiration.

C. Plan your site based on design principles:
   - I chose to exaggerate the design principle of repetition, as evident from the repeated images and elements throughout your website.

D. Include at least 10 pictures throughout the 3 web pages:
   - Each web page includes 10 images, which meet this requirement.

E. Demonstrate knowledge of the Box Model:
   - I used the border property in two instances (body and h1 elements).
   - I applied the padding property in three instances (body, nav, and p elements).
   - I implemented the margin property in two instances (body and nav elements).

F. Inline vs. Block:
   - I used consecutive inline elements in one instance (nav ul li elements).
   - I used consecutive block elements in two instances (h1 and p elements).

G. Demonstrate knowledge of positioning elements:
 - I used the float property in two instances (image-container and another-image-container in style.css).
  - I applied relative positioning in three instances (relative-positioned-element in style.css, and you can apply it to two more elements as needed).
   - I used absolute positioning in two instances (absolute-positioned-element in style.css, and you can apply it to another element as needed).

H. Create different background colors for each page:
   - Each web page has a distinct background color (Magenta, Orange, and Purple) as per your requirements.


Research of the "Worst Web Page Ever":


Exaggerated Design Principle: Excessive Repetition

For the "Worst Web Page Ever," I chose to exaggerate the design principle of excessive repetition. The idea was to create a web page that purposefully defies good design principles by overloading it with repeated elements and the excessive use of various design attributes.

Disliked Colors and Web Attributes:

1. Poor Contrast: I deliberately used text and background colors that clash or have low contrast, making the text challenging to read. This poor contrast was included to create a frustrating user experience, as it's a common issue on poorly designed websites.

2. Lack of Alignment: Proper alignment is crucial in good web design, so I intentionally misaligned elements, causing visual chaos. This misalignment is a prevalent issue on bad websites and was included to exaggerate this design flaw.

3. Repetition: Excessive repetition of images was a key design element. Images were repeated in content and as background images, cluttering the page and creating an unappealing visual experience.

4. Proximity: I placed elements too closely together, violating the principles of proximity. This design choice made the content look crowded and unprofessional.

Inspiration from Bad Websites:

To create the "Worst Web Page Ever," I took inspiration from various poorly designed websites that exhibit the mentioned design flaws. While these websites serve as examples of what not to do in web design, I'd like to emphasize that these links are for illustrative purposes and not endorsements of bad design:

1. https://www.gatesnfences.com/ - This website also demonstrates some design weaknesses. There is an excessive use of different font styles, sizes, and colors, which creates a sense of visual chaos. The layout lacks hierarchy, making it challenging for users to find the information they're looking for. The navigation menu is not intuitive, and the use of large images slows down the loading speed. Overall, the design lacks simplicity and fails to provide a cohesive user experience.

2. https://sfbay.craigslist.org/ - While Craigslist serves a practical purpose as an online classifieds platform, its design can be seen as outdated and clunky. The interface is text-heavy and lacks visual appeal, making it less engaging for users. The overall design could benefit from a more modern and user-friendly approach, with improved navigation and a cleaner layout. However, it's worth noting that Craigslist focuses on functionality rather than aesthetics, and its design may be intentionally kept simple to prioritize content and usability.

These websites served as a source of inspiration for creating a website that deliberately incorporates these disliked design attributes and provides a clear example of what not to do when designing a web page.
